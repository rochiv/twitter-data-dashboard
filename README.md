# Twitter Data Dashboard

### Introduction

The Twitter Data Dashboard is a data mining and data visualization proof of concept that allows an individual to analyze twitter trends associated with the most popular car makers and the most populated cities in the United States. 

### Why is the Twitter Data Dashboard necessary?

Any data metric that can be observed over time is very beneficial to decision making since Twitter is a platform for advertising, news, and opinions.
